Do you know what your Congressperson is doing right now? Are they carefully considering and representing your interests? Are they carefully crafting bills that are supported by you and your neighbor, or for the American people at large? Are they carefully reading bills that other congresspeople have proposed and considering their opinions on the nuances of each bill so that they can make well informed votes? Or are they fundraising for their next election? [0] Partying with lobbyists? Or maybe just letting the industries they purport to regulate, write their bills for them? [1]

How can we, the voters who hire people to represent us in our governments, ever know the answers to these questions? Do we rely on corporate media conglomorates whose parent companies actively lobby the same people they report on to accurately represent your interests? Do those conglomorates put words directly into the mouths of the people we have elected [2] to find out all of the facts about what our representatives are doing and to report them accurately? Do we rely on those conglomorates to explain those facts in fair and balanced ways so that we, the voters, can make highly informed decisions about who will represent us?


Should we?


The structure that we currently operate under may have been out of neccessity in a world where it was difficult to source and distribute information. Previously, you needed enourmous resources to broadcast radio or television signals distances vast enough to reach the majority of people. Being able to produce and distribute daily newspapers across the country is a difficult and resource intensive endeavor.

All of that has changed now.

No longer are we reliant on centrally controlled newspapers, radio, or television.

The Internet and World Wide Web empowers us to democratize both the sourcing and distribution of information. Information from anyone can be made available to everyone else on the planet in fractions of a second. There is no longer a need to relegate what is believed to be the most important part of a free society, a cell informed citizenry, to a handful of corporations that are more concerned with selling your viewing time to advertisers for the profits of their shareholders and executives.
