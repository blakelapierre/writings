What is your Congressperson doing right now? Threatening reporters (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeJhXaC5WPg&feature=youtu.be&t=3s)? Storing bribe money in their freezer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Jefferson_corruption_case#mediaviewer/File:WilliamJeffersonFreezerPiecrusts_20-45C.jpg)? Sexting their teenage Pages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Foley_congressional_page_incident)?

Congresspeople now spend over half of their time fundraising or speaking with lobbyists and other influence peddlers (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/08/call-time-congressional-fundraising_n_2427291.html)[need better source]. Political parties recommend that their congressional members spend less than half of their working time dealing with actual Congressional matters[link to Congress Powers] or handling issues relevant to their constituents.

How can you find out what your congressperson is doing? We are almost completely dependent on the popular media to feed us small bits of information about what the most powerful body [examples: war, massive budgets, investigations, criminal law, etc] in the world is doing.
