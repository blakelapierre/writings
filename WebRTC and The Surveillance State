WebRTC and The Surveillance State

Conjecture: The Law is not Fixed, but constructed by man.

Ubiquitous, secure, world-wide communication is upon us.

We still struggle with the same problems we always have: how to feed everyone, how to care for everyone, and how to resolve disputes.

The playing field may soon be leveled again, but this time it might actually be anyone able to communicate with any (and perhaps all) others, at least, as much as one can communicate over digitized audio and video signals sent over the Internet.



Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)
  "Real-time Communication Between Browsers"

  A collection of technologies and an interface that allows any web browser connected to the Internet to communicate audio, video, and arbitrary data directly with any other browser connected to the network over extremely secure encrypted channels. The audio and video can come directly from the microphones and video cameras attached or built-in to the device running the web browser. Additionally, private networks can be overlayed on the Internet to facilitate duplicating & relaying the real-time streams received by one browser to a third browser. Using these tools, it is possible to securely communicate at global scale.

  There are currently billions of machines capable of utilizing WebRTC. Many (most?) are mobile phone devices that have multiple connections to the Internet.



Surveillance State
  Define surveillance:
    close observation, especially of a suspected spy or criminal.

  Define state:
    the particular condition that someone or something is in at a specific time.
    a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government.


It is the duty of the citizen to surveil the state and to make changes as appropriate.
