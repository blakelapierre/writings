Food Should Be Free

As in, every person on the planet should be able to access high quality produce sufficient to meet their nutritionary needs. Not every person on the planet can produce sufficient food for themselves and/or their families by themself, nor should they have to. Maybe we could each do it in theory, if we divided up all of the arable land on the planet and provided each person with sufficient resources (water, seed) to farm their land. I doubt many of you reading this essay would like to live in a world like that. I know I don't. Gardening is a fun and rewarding hobby, but farming for a lifetime just to stay alive is not. Of course, there may be a small minority who would like to try and I don't think there is any harm in affording them the opportunity to do so.

Money Is An Illusion (And For Some, A Delusion)

Money doesn't matter. I mean that in this sense: money is not an end (although many may believe so) and does not give you much, if anything, by itself. If you hold some hard currency, you may be able to burn it for heat, either for comfort or conversion to directed mechanical motion, or perhaps melt it into a more physically useful form. If metal, you may also use it as an electric conductor. Those uses are minimially effective, trivial, and generally will be ignored. I find that the entire line of agrumentation is trite, however if someone wants to continue it I would be happy to entertain them for awhile.

Most money, however, does not take physical form (except for transient disturbances in electro-magnetic fields) and therefore has no physical use whatsoever.
