They who create the tools, create the rules --

At least some of the rules.


Other tools may exist and your tool may allow for uses other than what you originally intended to specify, but if a tool is useful and widely used it largely defines the space of the possible creations.

Some say that if all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.

Let's change things around a bit and consider that if you don't have a hammer, you'd better have a nailgun, screw-driver, or adhesive, otherwise you're stuck with destructive solid geometry techniques which will put hard constraints on what you can build.

What do your tools allow and what rules do they specify?
