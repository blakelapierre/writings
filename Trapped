Trapped

We are trapped in a bubble of our own understanding. Obvious? Sure. Interesting, nonetheless. How can you interact with something that exists outside the limits of your understanding? Well, you may not even know that you are interacting with anything. Not if you aren't even aware of the concept of the thing itself... Sure, in the strictest sense, you *are* interacting with it (assuming you 'actually' are [physical reality?]), but as far as your conscious process perceives and believes, you may have zero (conciously known) knowledge about the 'thing' and its nature, how it operates and affects the other things around it.

If you aren't able to predict the effects of your actions (and possible interactions with things that you have no knowledge of), how can you successfully select actions to take to achieve your goals (or if you have none, mere survival)?
